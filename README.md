# Welcome to Game O' Odds

This is an educational mockup of popular gambling sites, such as stake or others, however no real money or anything is on the line, as points can be reset, and progress reset whenever the player wants.

This teaches kids and other people the downsides of gambling, even though this site is just math, and no real competetive aspect other than to compete with your friends to see who will have the highest score!

# Usage
You can either go to the [Github Pages](https://rapidongfuel.github.io/gambleing-frontend/) of the site, or you can clone the site on your own and run it locally!

# Locally:
```git
gh repo clone RapidOnGfuel/gambleing-frontend
```
Then go to where you installed it and open index.html
